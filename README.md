CS4222 Software Development Assessment

Part 4 Specification

Introduction
The goal of this exercise is to explore how Java “Map” structures might be used to develop a Java program that processes a file of data about course applicants. The task could be described as a “maintenance” exercise in that we are given an existing piece of code and asked to modify it, or in this case, add components to complete it. So part of the exercise involves understanding how the existing code works, and part of it requires us to write the additional code and incorporate it into the solution.
